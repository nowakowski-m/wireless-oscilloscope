--- In final version of project, can change timeout of trying to connect with eth0 for 1s.
--- It will make the device run faster, because now it's trying to connect with LAN,
--- even when there is no ethernet cable connected physically.
--- Now have to leave it like this, for proper internet access, while working on project.

--- Maybe I can use some other library for plots, like Plotly or D3.js,
--- which may be better for live updating data.

--- Look for knobs or some other simillar input type, for scaling
--- scope screen, etc.

--- Rearange graph X scale, to time. It should have max. val. equal to time value set by
--- range input by user. It should be divided some times, according to frequency of measures.

--- Specify any default scale of Y, according to device limits.

--- Add start and pause buttons for measuring.
